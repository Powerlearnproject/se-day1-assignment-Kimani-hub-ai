#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Its a procedure of developing , testing and maintaining softwares.its importance are:
     i)reliability-Software engineering processes, such as testing and quality assurance, help create robust applications that minimize 
                   bugs and security vulnerabilities.
     ii)improved efficiency-Methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and CI/CD streamline development, reducing time-to-market.
     iii)Supports scalability-Well-engineered software can scale to accommodate growing user bases and evolving requirements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1)The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)-The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering 
 Conference in response to the "Software Crisis."
  2)The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s - 1990s)-The introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software design by organizing code into reusable objects rather than procedural logic.
  3)The Agile Manifesto and Modern Development Practices (2001 - Present)-Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban replaced rigid Waterfall models, allowing faster adaptation to customer needs and market changes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

   1)planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
   2)requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
   3)design - building the framework. 
   4)coding - converting software design into tangible code.
   5)testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.Example:
          i)Regulated Industries – Healthcare or financial applications requiring strict compliance and documentation.
  agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles.Example:
          i)Software Development – Web and mobile applications that evolve based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    i)Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
    ii)Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
    iii)Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    i)IDE example VS code:Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
    ii)version control systems example Git: are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    i)-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
              Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their 
                        skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
    ii)lack of adequate infrastruture 
                solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  i)Unit tests -it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
  ii) Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together
  iii)System testing  -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, 
                        usability, and security .
   iv)Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirement. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
                     

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
       prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.  Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    vague prompt - "Tell me about cars."
    improved prompt - "Give me an overview of electric cars, including their advantages, disadvantages, and top models in 2025."

             how it has improved
    
   Clarity – Instead of a broad topic, it specifies "electric cars" rather than all cars.
   Specificity – It asks for particular details: advantages, disadvantages, and top models.
   Conciseness – It removes ambiguity while keeping the request straightforward.
